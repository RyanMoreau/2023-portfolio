# Astro Portfolio

Welcome to my one-page portfolio, built with Astro! This project showcases my skills and experience in web development, and is designed to be a simple and elegant way to present my work to potential clients and employers.

## Features
- *One-page design:* My portfolio is designed to be a single, scrollable page that showcases all of my work and experience in one place.

- *Scroll snap:* The page uses scroll snap to create a smooth and intuitive scrolling experience, making it easy for users to navigate through my content.

- *Astro-powered:* This portfolio is built with Astro, a modern static site builder that makes it easy to create fast and efficient websites.

- *Deployed on Railway:* I've set up this project to deploy on Railway, using the Node adapter. This makes it easy to deploy and manage my portfolio in the cloud.
